# GitHub Repository Setup - Step by Step

## Step 1: Create Repository on GitHub

1. Go to: https://github.com/testedcode
2. Click the **"+"** button (top right) → **"New repository"**
3. Fill in:
   - **Repository name:** `hasya-yoga-website` (or any name you like)
   - **Description:** "Hasya Yoga Website - React + Firebase + Vercel"
   - **Visibility:** Choose **Public** or **Private**
   - **IMPORTANT:** Do NOT check:
     - ❌ Add a README file
     - ❌ Add .gitignore
     - ❌ Choose a license
   (We already have these files!)
4. Click **"Create repository"**

## Step 2: Copy the Repository URL

After creating, GitHub will show you a page with commands. You'll see a URL like:
- `https://github.com/testedcode/hasya-yoga-website.git`

**Copy this URL** - we'll need it in the next step!

## Step 3: Connect and Push (I'll help you with this)

Once you've created the repo, tell me the repository name you used, and I'll help you push the code!
